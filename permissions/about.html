        <h1 id="background">What is permissions checking?</h1>
        <p>
          It’s understanding what version of your work you can deposit, where, how, and when. Depending on when you published, with which publisher, which journal, and at which institution in which country, the answer can be quite different. Figuring this out is known as permissions checking, and it’s one of the biggest hurdles when self-archiving. While we don’t talk about it much as a community, getting it right and making it easy stands between us and a transformation in how self-archiving is done. For authors and librarians alike (and the tools they use), permissions checking is a complex and slow task, and there isn’t enough tooling to help digest the myriad policies into clear answers.
        </p>

      <h1 id="howitworks">How it works</h1>
      <p>
        Information on how it works can be found <a href="/permissions#learnmore">here on the homepage</a>, and more specifics, e.g the schema can be found on this page. If you’d like to know more, <a href="mailto:joe@openaccessbutton.org">send us a question</a> and we’ll happily get back to you asap.

      <h1 id="contributing">Contributing</h1>
      <!-- TODO: I don't like this section generally -->
      <p>
        Thanks so much for making it this far! There are three major ways we need the community to help, but before you do please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHEYlQYogYhdS7nXajM68cd2pMbKwJSahcr-NP9vVL-dzzYA/viewform">let us know who you are</a>:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contribute individual policies: If you find we don’t have a policy you know, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0_nEfBN142m-oW7t1AzVJVhh09LeYMEJsooNLIOFYpA6Byw/viewform?usp=sf_link">contribute it here</a>.</li>
          <!-- TODO: the below needs revision -->
          <li>Review policies: When new policies are submitted, they need to be reviewed by one other person for verification. But, policies also change, so we ensure all policies are archived when submitted and automatically monitor important policies for changes, with others are manually reviewed by the community regularly. We’d like your support, so there is a feed of policies that need review, and a way to review them here: Coming Soon.</li>
          <li>Contribute in bulk: If you have a list of policies locally you think we could use, we’d love to work with you to include them. <a href="mailto:Joe@openaccessbutton.org">Get in touch</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        We’ll accept contributions from anyone; however, we’ll ask you to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHEYlQYogYhdS7nXajM68cd2pMbKwJSahcr-NP9vVL-dzzYA/viewform">identify who you are</a> and source your information. We recommend contributing only if you are intimately familiar with what you’re contributing to, e.g. you’re a trained scholarly communications practitioner (or trained by one) or a journal editor / publisher.
        <br>
        <br>
        Your contribution will be licensed openly, CC-0, and attributed to you. At any point, you can get your contribution back by downloading the data.

      <!-- TODO: - I know this is a draft but maybe finding a way to tidy up a little how API docs are displayed?

      It's just the format - the spaces between the lines maybe could be a little bit shorter? and change the size of the font of the subheadings (/affiliations, /:doi /journal) could be like 1 size smaller so that you don't have to think twice that they're all parts of API docs. Apart from that I think everything is fine!

        <br>

        The API gives responses as shown in the Schema, however, most fields should be straightforward to understand without it.

        You don’t need to authenticate to use the API, but if you’re going to rely on it we recommend joining the mailing list to get updates.

      <p>
        We have lots of plans. Some of the highlights include:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting to 100% coverage of publisher policies for journal articles. We’re working down the list of publishers and exploring a data-driven approach to doing this.</li>
          <li>Interfaces that allow authors and libraries to get more information on a one-by-by basis in Shareyourpaper.org.</li>
          <li>Improve data coverage for conference proceedings and preprints.</li>
          <li>Consider expanding the data schema for where you can post, and provide terms for deposit in subject repositories and author websites.</li>
          <li>Streamline querying if you don’t have a DOI, or have a Datacite DOI.</li>
        </ul>
